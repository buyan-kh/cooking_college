# Deepify: 3-Minute Pitch Script

"Hi everyone, I'm Buyan and I'm excited to introduce you to Deepify, an AI-powered study companion that transforms how students learn and retain information.

**[PROBLEM - 30 seconds]**
Let me ask you: Have you ever crammed for an exam, only to forget everything a week later? You're not alone. Studies show that students retain just 10% of what they learn after 3 months using traditional study methods. The problem is that our education system focuses on information delivery, not information retention. Students are overwhelmed with content but lack effective tools to process and retain what matters.

**[SOLUTION - 45 seconds]**
Deepify solves this by creating personalized learning journeys powered by AI. Here's how it works:

First, upload your syllabus. Our AI analyzes it and creates a structured roadmap of topics.

Next, Deepify generates pre-lecture quizzes to prime your brain before class, making lectures more engaging and effective.

Then, add your notes - type them, upload documents, or even take pictures of your handwritten notes. Our AI analyzes them and creates custom quizzes that target exactly what you need to learn.

What makes us unique is our spaced repetition system. Based on how confident you feel with each answer, Deepify schedules review sessions at scientifically optimal intervals, dramatically improving long-term retention.

Let me show you how it works.

[Brief demo of the syllabus upload and roadmap generation]

Here's where it gets interesting - when I upload a photo of my handwritten biology notes, watch how Deepify uses vision AI to extract the content and generate quizzes. No more typing out pages of notes!

The quizzes are generated in seconds, each question targeting key concepts with multiple-choice options that challenge your understanding rather than just recall.

**[MARKET & BUSINESS MODEL - 30 seconds]**
We're targeting the 20 million U.S. college students who spend over $10 billion annually on study aids and tutoring. Our freemium model offers basic features free, with a $4.99 monthly subscription for advanced features like handwritten note analysis and unlimited quizzes.

We've completed our MVP and early testing with 50 students shows a 40% increase in quiz scores after just two weeks of using Deepify.

**[VISION & CALL TO ACTION - 30 seconds]**
We're not just building another study tool - we're reimagining how education works. In the future, we'll expand to offer analytics dashboards for professors, integrate with learning management systems, and develop collaborative study features.

Today, we're seeking partners to help us pilot Deepify in university settings this fall semester. If you're passionate about transforming education through technology, let's talk after the presentation.

Thank you!"
